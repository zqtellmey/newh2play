"""
Verification helpers for the NopeCHA captcha-solving service.

The browser-side flow loads NopeCHA as a Chrome extension and injects the API key
via https://nopecha.com/setup#KEY. That flow can fail silently — the extension may
keep using a stale key persisted from a previous run, or the setup page may not
finish writing to chrome.storage before we close it.

This module provides an independent, network-level check: it talks directly to the
NopeCHA HTTP API to confirm the key is real and accepted by their backend, without
involving the browser or extension at all.
